This section includes packages for disabling/restoring the Windows system function: **User Account Control**

>[!caution]
>This is a feature for advanced users! Use it at your own risk!

- Disabling UAC makes it easier for you to run programs, batch script files, etc., anything that requires administrator rights to work correctly.
- This will disable notifications that an application requires administrator rights.
- This can increase security risks if you are careless online and download files from unreliable sources.
